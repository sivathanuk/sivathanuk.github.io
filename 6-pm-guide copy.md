Why DeepWork is important?

- If you can’t learn you won’t thrive.
- Once the talent market is made universally accessible those at the peak of the market thrive while the rest suffer. (Remote working is on the rise nowadays)

**In the economy, 3 groups will have particular Advantage**

- Those who can work well with intelligent machines (Highly Skilled)
- Those who are best at what they do (Rockstars)
- Those who have access to capital (Owners)

These two groups (Highly skilled & Rockstars) are poised to thrive and I claim are accessible.

### High Quality Work

- To learn hard things quickly you must focus intensely without distraction.(DeepWork)
- Three to four hours a day, five days a week of uninterrupted & carefully directed concentration can produce a lot of valuable output.
- High Quality work = Time spent * Intensity of focus

### Focus

- The mindset of transforming your life from distracted to focused overnight if you can muster enough motivation is appealing but it ignores the difficulty.
- The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained.
- Once you're wired for distraction you crave it. To succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distraction stimuli.
- Blocking away distractions for a certain period will make you feel bored and you will crave distraction and as time moves forward it will become a session of concentration calisthenics.
- Reduce the impact of network tools eg: Facebook, Twitter & Instagram, etc.

### Productivity

Mastering the relevant skills is necessary but not sufficient. You must then transform that latest potential into tangible results that people value.

If you don’t produce you won’t thrive- no matter how skilled or talented you are.

Don’t excuse busyness as a proxy for productivity

### Attention Management

- Your world is the outcome of what you pay attention to.
- Skillful management of attention is the sine qua non of the good life and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your experience.
- In research by Sophie Leroy, while switching from Task A to Task B your attention doesn’t immediately follow, a residue of your attention remains stuck thinking about the original task.

**Routines**

- The key is to move beyond good intentions and add routines & rituals to your working life.
- Your ritual needs rules and processes to keep your efforts structures and concentration honed.
- Measure your success in a way that motivates you in the day to day behavior and in hindsight also progress you towards your long term goals.

### Time Blocking

- Schedule your time. Break it into blocks of deep work sessions
- Allow for uncertainty in your schedule.
- When you work, work hard. When you’re done be done.

* * *

### Mental Recharge

- Do a mental recharge i.e no email checks, no mental replays of conversations, etc.
- Put more thought in your leisure time when it comes to relaxation don’t default to whatever catches your attention at the moment.
- Mental faculties are capable of a continuous hard activity they don’t tire like an arm or leg. All they want is change.
- Whenever you feel mentally tired. Change to something different.
- Don’t just say yes to everything.
- You have a finite amount of willpower that depletes as you use it.

### Misc

- After the shutdown, the incomplete tasks will dominate your attention throughout your day.
- It is a fantasy to think that you will reach a point where all your obligations are handled.
