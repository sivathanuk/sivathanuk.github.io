 â€“ Naval

Compounding happens when the rate of growth of a phenomenon increases with time. It can be applied to the rate of decay as well. Every small, consistent, positive step taken, spanning over a period of time, compounds and result in an exponential improvement. <b>Consistency</b> is the key here. 

Some real life examples, 
1. 40 mins of physical activiy daily for 20 years - good health 
2. Smoking cigarattes everyday for 20 years - poor health
3. Journaling everday for 10 years - become a better writer
4. Investing 20% of monthy income on index funds for 25 years - financial wealth 
5. Solving coding puzzles everday for 10 years - become a better programmer

Mathematically, how 1% daily improvement vs 1% daily decay spans out at the end of an year! 
``` 
   (1)^365 = 1
(1.01)^365 = 37.8   
(0.99)^365 = 0.03
```
