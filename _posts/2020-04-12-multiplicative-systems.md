We live in a world where different parts interact with each other to generate an outcome. Some of the interactions may be additive. But, in most of the complex systems, the interactions are multiplicative. 

Try answering the below, 
```
2563 * 603 * 4578 * 1257 = ?
2563 * 19874 * 0 * 39856 = 0
5467 + 67687 + 0 + 52494 = ? 
```
It's easier to answer the middle one, where <b>muliplying by zero</b> makes the result zero. Same applies for complex systems as well. Whe one part of the complex system fails, the entire system fails. 

<b> Multiplicative model in real world scenario: </b>

Consider a consumer electronics company that-
* makes high quality products 
* ships feature updates regularly
* sells the products at an affordable price

But, the company's customer care department is terrible. The department is undertrained and understaffed. Customer queries are never resolved or the customers have to call the customer support several times to resolve an issue. 

Customers will never come back and share the bad experience on public forums, further damaging the reputation of the company. Gains from all other departments are lost due to one department that is extremely bad. 
```
quality (Q) * features (F) * price (P) * support (0) = 0
```
