Setting goals help us move in the direction of success. We all have personal and professional goals in life. We work hard towards achieving the goals and move forward. 

Inversion framework works on the principle of addition by subtraction. Inversion works as below, 
```
1.You have a goal to achieve
2.Think about all possible actions that gurantee failure
3.Do less of the actions that guarantee failure
```
Example 1: Applying Inversion to achieve a fitness goal
1. Goal: I want to lose weight 
2. Path to Failure: What's the sure shot way to gain weight?
* Eat junk food
* Stay physically inactive 
* Drink less water
* Go to bed very late 
* Sleep only 5 hrs a day
3. Action: Now do the opposite of all the above to lose weight

Example 2: Applying Inversion to build reading habit
1. Goal: I want to read more books
2. Path to Failure: How to read less?
* Browse the internet aimlessely
* Spend a lot of time on Twitter
* Participate voluntarily in WhatsApp group conversations
* Procrastinate reading to later part of the day
3. Action: Now do the opposite of all the above to read more books

Inversion can be applied to professional, financial and relationship goals as well.
