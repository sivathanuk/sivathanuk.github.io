Naval is one of my favorite personalities on twitter. He is a wise person and shares tidbits of his wisdom thru tweets / persicope sessions. 

In a periscope session, he shared the frameworks he uses to make decisions. They are, 

1. <b>To make right long-term decisions:</b>
We live in a world full of choices. If you can't decide, then the answer is "No". 

2. <b>To make a choice between equally good alternatives:</b>
If you have to make a choice between two alternatives that are equally good (50:50), chose the one that is more difficult and more painful in the short-term vs the one that looks easy in the short-term but gets painful in the long-term. Short-term pain leads to long term gain. The gains are compounded long-term. 

3. <b>To deal with inter-personal conflicts:</b>
Make the choice that makes you more equanimous in the long term. The choice that helps you stay calmer in the long run is the right one.
