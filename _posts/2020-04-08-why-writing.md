Deleting my facebook account in 2017 is one of the best decisions I have ever made. But the FOMO effect demanded presence in at least one form of social media. I thought I’ll explore twitter to start with.

I was quite amazed by the power of twitter as a platform. Twitter though centralized, allows decentralized feeds at user-level in the form of lists. I discovered so many interesting personalities thru twitter. I started following them. I’ve also created twitter lists to exclusively access feeds from people I followed.

My twitter lists became my source of learning. My favorite topics include data science, product management, investing, privacy, decentralization, philosophy, math, physical fitness, books etc. I believe hours of scrolling curated twitter feeds is as good as reading books, but in a highly fragmented manner. To my surprise, I started reading books the same way I scroll twitter feeds - read whatever I like, whenever I like based on my mood and interest at the moment.

I realised 140 (now 280 characters) restriction on twitter allows users to be more creative and concise while tweeting / replying. This made me realise that concise writing helps to think more clearly. I decided to start blogging. However, I always believed that any asset on the internet should be our own wherever possible. Also, most of my favourite twitter handles use their own domains (no medium / susbtack). Discovered jekyll thru twitter, thought I’ll explore jekyll as well as blogging. Let’s see how this spans out.
