title:  Organizing the Blog - Topics  
categories: misc
---

I enjoy organizing things - be it my workspace, my laptop or my mobile phone. I believe that an organized setup saves a lot of time and helps in thinking clearly. I wanted to organize this blog as well, based on my favorite topics: Product design, strategy, system design, ux,  analytics, decision-making, consumer psychology etc. 

I have created a reading list, organized books into kindle collections and started reading books based on my mood and interest. I have planned to write reviews of books as I finish reading them. 

Mental models are set of frameworks that help to understand the world around us. I'll be sharing the summary of mental models I have come across in this space. 

I have organized this blog into below topics, 
* books - book reviews, summary
* tech - coding, system design, analytics
* design - ux, consumer psychology 
* execution - strategy, decision-making 
* mental models 
* miscellaneous
